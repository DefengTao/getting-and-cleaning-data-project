# getting-and-cleaning-data-project

 This project is for Getting and Cleaning Data Project. In the R script, what I did are (by order):
 1. Extracts only th measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
    All of the measurement is from the file: "feature.txt"
 2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
    Combine the train data set and test data set seperately. And then, they are merged together.
 3. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names
 4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    All the names are from the file: "activity_label.txt"
 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
