# getting-and-cleaning-data-project

# This project is for Getting and Cleaning Data Project. In the R script, what I did are (by order):
## 1. Extracts only th measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
## 2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
## 3. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names
## 4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
